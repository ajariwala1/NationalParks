# NationalParks

Use a single-screen layout to explore U.S. national parks by state. After a short intro screen with swipeable scenic highlights, display a scrollable grid of parks filtered by state. Each park appears as a card with a thumbnail image and name. Tapping a card opens a detail view with the park’s description, contact information, map location, entrance fee, and a list of available activities. All data is loaded live from the National Park Service API.

This is a skeleton project that includes all assets you need to build the NationalParks application.

## Getting Started

## What you will learn

- Build a swipeable intro screen using TabView with paging style.
- Create custom SwiftUI views to display parks in a scrollable grid layout.
- Use NavigationStack and NavigationLink to navigate between screens.
- Decode nested JSON data from a live API using Swift’s Codable protocol.
- Load remote images efficiently using AsyncImage with placeholder support.
- Manage view state with @State, @StateObject, and @Published properties.
- Apply the MVVM pattern to organize network logic using a dedicated view model.
- Use @AppStorage to persist onboarding completion and control launch flow.
- Display structured data like activities and entrance fees using dynamic views.
